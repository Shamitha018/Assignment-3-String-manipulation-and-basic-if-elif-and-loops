# Assignment-3-String-manipulation-and-basic-if-elif-and-loops
Assigned on 15th September 2025. covers string manipulation and if elif and loops topics
1. Basics of Python Using Strings

These problems focus on string manipulation, a fundamental skill in any programming
language. You will practice creating, combining, and formatting text strings to generate simple
messages and labels.

Greeting Message
Create a variable `customer_name` with the value "Priya". Print a personalized greeting
message: "Hello, Priya! Welcome."
1:

Item Label
Create two variables: `item_name` with "Mango Blast" and `price_per_item` with 80. Print
a formatted label showing both pieces of information: "Item: Mango Blast, Price: 80 INR".
2:

Order Summary
Create variables `item1` ("Vanilla Delight"), `item2` ("Chocolate Chip"), and `total_cost`
(300). Print a summary line: "Order: Vanilla Delight, Chocolate Chip. Total: 300 INR."
3:

Dynamic Message
Create variables `staff_name` ("Arjun") and `current_time` ("10:00 AM"). Print a message
announcing the staff member on duty: "Current staff member on duty: Arjun. Time: 10:00
AM."
4:

String Length
Find and print the length of the string "Strawberry Sensation".
5:

Capitalization
Create a variable `flavor_name` with "butterscotch crunch". Print the flavor name with the
first letter of each word capitalized.
6:

Finding Substrings
Check if the word "Milk" is present in the ingredient list string "Milk, Cream, Sugar,
Vanilla". Print `True` or `False` based on the result.
7:

Replacing Text
In the string "The order is for Rahul. Total amount: 250 INR.", replace the name "Rahul"
with "Sneha". Print the new string.
8:

Trimming Whitespace
Remove any leading or trailing spaces from the string " Chocolate Fudge " and print the
cleaned string.
9:

Splitting a String
Split the string "Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday" by the comma and print the resulting list
of days.
10:

2. Flow Control Blocks - if/else and loops

These problems introduce the use of conditional statements and loops to control the flow of a
program. You will make decisions based on certain conditions and repeat actions for multiple
items.
Joining a List
Join the list of ingredients `['Milk', 'Sugar', 'Cream']` into a single string separated by
hyphens: "Milk-Sugar-Cream".
11:

Formatted Receipt Line
Use an f-string to print a receipt line for an item. The item is "Pista" and the price is 120
INR. The output should be "Item: Pista, Price: 120.00 INR".
12:

Multi-line String
Create a multi-line string that holds an address: "Shop No. 5, Main Road, City Center".
Print this string.
13:

String Reversal
Take the string "Daily Report" and print it in reverse order.
14:

Character Counting
Count the number of times the letter 'a' appears in the string "Banana Caramel".
15:

Single Condition Check
Create a variable `current_stock` with the value 50. If `current_stock` is less than 20, print
"Low stock warning."
1:

Basic if/else
Create a variable `order_status` with "Pending". If the status is "Pending", print "Order is
being prepared.". Otherwise, print "Order is complete."
2:

Multiple Conditions with elif
Create a variable `temperature` with 25. If the temperature is above 30, print "High
ambient temperature.". If it's between 20 and 30 (inclusive), print "Normal operating
temperature.". Otherwise, print "Low ambient temperature."
3:

Price-based Discount
A customer's total bill is 550 INR. If the total is over 500 INR, a 10% discount is applied.
Calculate and print the final amount. Otherwise, print the original total.
4:

For Loop: Iterating over a list
Print each item from the list of flavors: `['Vanilla', 'Chocolate', 'Strawberry']`.
5:

For Loop with a condition
Iterate through the list of flavors `['Vanilla', 'Chocolate', 'Strawberry', 'Mango']`. Print only
the flavors that are not 'Strawberry'.
6:

While Loop for a Countdown
Simulate a timer for a process that takes 5 minutes. Start a variable `timer` at 5 and print
a message each time it decreases, until it reaches 0. E.g., "5 minutes remaining...", "4
minutes remaining...", etc.


A machine takes 10 seconds to make a batch. Simulate this process using a loop that
counts down from 10 to 1, printing the remaining time at each step. End with "Process
complete."
